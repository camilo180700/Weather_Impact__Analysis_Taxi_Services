🚕 Impact of Weather and Demand on Taxi Services

📌 Project Description

This project analyzes real-world taxi service data to understand demand patterns, company performance, and the impact of weather conditions on trip duration.

The analysis was developed after a prior phase of SQL exercises, where the necessary datasets were obtained through structured queries. Once the data was extracted, Python was used for data exploration, visualization, and statistical validation.

🎯 Objectives

Identify the neighborhoods with the highest average number of trips.

Analyze taxi companies with the highest trip volumes.

Evaluate the impact of weather conditions on trip duration.

Validate hypotheses using statistical tests.

🛠️ Methodology

Data loading and exploration

Importing datasets previously generated using SQL.

Reviewing data structure, data types, and missing values.

Exploratory data analysis

Ranking neighborhoods by average number of trips.

Analyzing the top 10 taxi companies and grouping the rest as Other.

Visualizations to identify demand patterns.

Hypothesis testing

Comparing trip durations on rainy vs non-rainy days.

Applying statistical tests to validate significant differences.

Conclusions

Interpreting results based on statistical evidence.

📊 Key Findings

Neighborhoods with the highest average number of trips concentrate a large share of urban demand.

A small group of companies dominates the total number of trips.

Trips taken on rainy days show a higher average duration, with a statistically significant difference.
